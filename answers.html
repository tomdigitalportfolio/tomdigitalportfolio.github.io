        <h2 style="text-decoration: underline">My Goal</h2>
        <p>My goal for this year was to improve my thinking maps for my essays which will ultimately improve my grades. There aren't many ways of improving my thinking maps other than pratice, which I will continue to gain in the upcoming essays. A method I can use to formulate well-planned thinking maps is by typing them since I personally believe that I can understand and draw information from a typed thinking map rather than a written one. In addition, I will make sure that I create clear topic sentences and a specific thesis sentence.  </p>
        <h2 style="text-decoration: underline">My Stretch</h2>
   <p>My strech is my inability to participate in class discussions and debates. I have acknowledged the fact that I definetely need to raise my hand, answer questions, etc, however sometimes I feel the need to have a completely formulated answer before raising my hand, which leads to people being called on before me. As a result, my participation is highly affected by this.  I have attempted to correct my stretch by formulating answers to questions that may be asked during class whilst doing homework, resulting in me not feeling as afraid to raise my hand since I had previously been formulating ideas before debates/corrections. </p>
        <h2 style="text-decoration: underline">My Strength</h2>
        <p>My strength is in group leadership. I believe that my strength has remained constant throughout the year. During the previous Social Studies project on the Virginia Plan, I believe that I was able to help keep everyone in my group focused on working on the presentation. In addition, since I don't participate in class as much as most students I try to make up for it when working in groups by organizing who in the group is to work on certain slides in order to complete the project in a designated amount of time.</p>
